# Matlab-Read-Image-And-Perform-Edits
This project was developed during my Computer Vision course. We were given an image, and our task was to write a Matlab script that performs various edits to the original image and auto-contrasts it. The edits to the image include increasing brightness, inverting the image, transforming the image to grayscale, and thresholding the image.
